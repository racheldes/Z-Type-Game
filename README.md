HOW TO PLAY 

As the words fall down the screen, start typing a word
to activate it. The activated word will turn cyan. 

To move on to the next word, you must finish typing the 
current active word.

Once a word hits the bottom of the screen, the game is 
over.

Purpose:
Created a utility class to handle generating words, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.
Implemented abstraction by designing classes for game elements such as letters, words, and the game board, simplifying complex interactions and promoting code clarity.
Utilized constructors to initialize game elements with appropriate attributes, streamlining game setup and improving code readability.
Integrated features such as difficulty levels and scoring based on typing accuracy, resulting in an engaging and challenging gameplay experience.
